How conference / event organisers can provide a better, more inclusive conference for attendees

A perpetually incomplete cheat sheet.

## Accommodation

Accommodation must be part of the budget.

- [ ] Live transcription
- [ ] Access ramps
- [ ] Elevators
- [ ] Have suitable space between seats
- [ ] Have breaks between talks.

## Safety

- [ ] Attendee code of conduct.
- [ ] Avenues of escalation.
- [ ] These avenues of escalation are clearly presented to attendees, before and during the conference.

## Inclusion

- [ ] Genderless bathrooms
- [ ] No subtle -isms, no microaggressions. To achieve 100% at a conference is impossible. But strive to have the most inclusive language possible, and point out your own mistakes if you see yourself doing them.
- [ ] Ensure diversity in representation with your speakers.
- [ ] Give away free/discounted tickets to minority attendees.
